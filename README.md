# UMIP MIPv6 implementation for Linux

This is a copy of the [UMIP.org original repository] which has been down for a while and don't know if it is going up again.

All credits for this code goes to the people at Helsinki University of Technology who originally developed the code. Please find below a copy of their readme. Some of the link are down or not maintained. I hpoe uploading this code will make people enchance the project.

As the code was released under GPL licence, I guess there's no problem sharing it, bearing in mind the licence.

In [my blog] there are some hints on how to compile and use MIPv6 both in [Linux (Ubuntu)][1] and [Android][2]. Feel free to comment, but note it's been a while since I last worked with it ;)
